# Ubisoft Interview Test

This project was done in 11 hours and gave me the opportunity to try out
a package I never used before. I used React as my UI framework and then utilized the react-bootstrap package to create the navbar and the video modals. I also used the react-multi-carousel package to create the carousels/swimlanes for the Games and Video sections; this is a package I never used before so it took me some time to read over the docs to get familiar with it. This homepage is also fully responsive for desktop/tablet/mobile.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope you enjoy it! :)
